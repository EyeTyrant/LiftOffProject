# LiftOffProject
LiftOff Project: Angular, Bootstrap front-end. Java Spring Boot, Hibernate, mySQL back-end.

## Collection Catalog

Collection Catalog is a web app allowing users to store and organize thier collections of a single type. The initial MVP will limit the type of collection to die cast vehicles.

Users will be able to input various aspects of thier collection to be saved in a database. Details can be retrieved with a search and displayed in a table formatted list where items can also be sorted, updated, and deleted.

Additional features presently considered include additional collection types (e.g., comic books, coins, stamps, albums), allowing users to add custom inputs, user log in and out, editable user profiles, and dispaying lists of links related to the collection type being viewed.

I hope to deploy this project to the web as soon as the MVP is ready and before implementing additional features.

Collection Catalog utilizes an Angular front-end for user interaction and client side validation. Bootstrap is employed to manage CSS. Some custom CSS is expected. Java Spring Boot will implement Hibernate to communicate with a mySQL database. VSCode, IntilliJ, and mySQL Workbench are being used to create this project. For this project I am also using Git for version control and Trello for progress tracking.
